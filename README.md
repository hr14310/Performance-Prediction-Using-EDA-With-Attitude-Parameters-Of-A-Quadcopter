# Performance-Prediction-using-EDA-with-Attitude-Parameters-of-a-Quadcopter.
Drones are widely used in the world for various applications ranging from a drone racing and until surveillance purposes. The performance of a drone could be predicted using exploratory data analysis thereby they could be maintained for safe and reliable field operations. Various techniques are being conducted in the industry to predict the performance of the drone in the industries. One such analysis would be the using the attitude parameters collected from the SD card of any flight controller used in quadcopters. Exploratory Data Analysis is applied to the obtained parameters and results are further compared for prediction of safe operation and unsafe operations for the next flight. We perform post flight analysis, where in the information is obtained from data flash log files when loaded in the mission planner software. The extracted data is sent into EDA model which predicts the reliable operation by using the mode function in the dataframe.
